Hello! My name is Krystella.

Thank you for your interest in my Python journey. 

In this repository you will find scripts related to courses/bootcamps/lectures I have participated in on my journey to learning Python.

I am currently undertaking the course **'Scientific Computing with Python'** on _freecodecamp.org_, instructed by _Prof. Charles Severance_ of the _University of Michigan_.
The lectures in this course are also offered as part of the **"Python for Everybody" Specialization** on _Coursera_, so some of the exercises found in this repo may be found there.
